#### Q1.

I will use "drink white wine" as treatment factor and use "time of swimming freestyle 50m" as response variable. I think it's useful to know whether drinking truly has some effects on swimming.

#### Q2.

Population: University students in Hofn, Arcadia and Colmar

#### Q3.

Does drinking white wine affect the swimming freestyle 50m performance for University students across the three islands?
